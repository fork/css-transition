# CSSTransition

Apply a CSS class for each stage of a CSS transition.

This is basically a react-free rip-off of [react-transition-group](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group).

It is super useful to make CSS transitions from `display: none;` to `display: whatever;`.

## Demo

There is a simple usage demo which can be run as follows:

    yarn
    yarn start
